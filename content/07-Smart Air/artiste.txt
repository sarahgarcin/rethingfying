##My approach to sensor based smart city infrastructure.
I am new in this field but I work with smart city technology in the City of Copenhagen. Our approach is to use data collected by sensors to streamline i.e. garbage collection. More important, my approach is to provide citizens with useful data, which sometimes means that the authorities must be by-passed or left out of the data collection and subsequent analysis because data might show results which does not align with policy or can lead to political problems. i.e. too poor air quality that does not match the ambition of a green sustainable city aspiring to become Co2 neutral in 2025. In short; data collection should empower citizenship and distribute power not consolidate authority or concentrate power.

##How can existing sensor-based smart-city infrastructure be repurposed, hacked, or used in a parasitical way?
Measuring air quality or other parameters should be open and accessible to citizens even if the data is gathered by authorities. I think that repurposing sensor infrastructure means handing it over to citizens in some way. The political choices about how to act on the data can then be discussed in an open forum. Sensor data should be distributed in open standards, be open sourced and accessible. The infrastructure as such can be hacked by re-writing licenses and ownership rights and making sure that the value generated flows back to the producers. As such, my concerns are mostly about ownership and profits from the data.
