titre : Air Quality Resources

text:
Although this is far from a comprehensive list, below are a few resources that you can refer to if you would like to follow up and learn more on the topics of air quality and air pollution, whether in London, the UK, or farther afield. 

We will continue to update this resource, which is also available on our website at http://www.citizensense.net/projects/urban-sensing/air-quality-resources. If you have any resources you would like to suggest, please send them to us at info@citizensense.net.


AIR QUALITY STANDARDS
The EU Air Quality Objective is the current legislation for air quality in the UK. The limitation for PM 2.5 is 25 µg/m3 over a 1-year period. 

As this is an average over a longer period of time than you will be undertaking monitoring, you can also compare your readings to the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidance for PM 2.5, which is 25 µg/m3 for the 24-hour mean, and 10 µg/m3 for the annual mean (lower than the EU Air Quality Objective).

More information on the EU Air Quality Objective is available at:
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/quality/standards.htm.

The WHO guidelines for particulate matter are available at:

LONDON AIR QUALITY RESOURCES
London’s air quality is officially monitored through the London Air Quality Network (LAQN), a network of monitoring stations that is managed by King’s College London. 

More information on London air quality, including readings at London air quality stations, can be found at: station infrastructure.
