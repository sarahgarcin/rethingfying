Once you have finished monitoring with your Dustbox, you can pack up the device in the box provided and return the device to the Deptford Lounge at the main circulation desk. 

The librarians will check in your device. They will then contact us so we can reprogram the device. 

We will assign the Dustbox a new and unique ID that is distinct from your Dustbox data, and return the reprogrammed Dustbox to the Deptford Lounge for additional checkout.

It will then be available for setup and use by the next person who wishes to collect particulate data. 

We would be delighted if you returned your logbook to us. Your logbooks will allow us to refer to your observations when analysing the data you have collected. You can include your logbook in the Dustbox package when you return it to the Deptford Lounge. We will then pick up your package and return it to Goldsmiths. 

If you have any questions about how to return your Dustbox, please contact info@citizensense.net.
