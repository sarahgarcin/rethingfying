My interest lies with the changing ontology of the household through the integration of smart technologies. Specifically in terms of its connection to critical infrastructures such as smart grids. What is happening is a downstream shift of the grid edge: the space at which active control over both the business management and energy management systems can be enacted. Traditionally this was at the transformer level, but now it is starting to encompass also the household. This creates a new frontier where actors of different worlds collide in a space with no previously established rules
of engagement.

Traditionally all infrastructural networks entered the premises concentrated at their own designated points of entry, now through the increases in bandwidth, latency and reliability of information
technologies, these insular systems are converging with ICT's. This changes the nature of gateways to the wider infrastructure both qualitatively and quantitatively. Firstly appliances, with new capacities are introduced to the domestic space that are individually enrolled through IaaS, PaaS, or
SaaS contracts and act based on incentives. Their physical interactions and interconnections are scheduled and based on their connection to real-time proprietary databases and analytics in the cloud. Intelligent thermostats, Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMI), Intelligent Energy Storage
Systems all dispose over their individual gateways that connect them to territorially distant, but
equivalent appliances through which they act on local flows of electricity. This means that domestic spaces are enrolled within bigger networks in forms that were previously impossible. The traditionally (safe) bounded economic unit is in the process of being broken up by distributed technologies that have software/network based depth and instead are reconstructed as a set of
separated load bearing entities able to act independently on the network through the virtual geographies they connect to.

Their integration seems rational due to an impressive rhetoric that binds together notions of efficiency, economic rationality, and sustainability. The different platforms that are becoming integrated in the household will in the future be able to stack different streams of value by enrolling the slightly dumber appliances into their domains of control, opening up of questions of agency in the process. The remit of the domestic thermostat is then not limited to governing the temperature by control of the AC or heaters, but extends to a full control over the domestic lighting, the ability to automatically lock and open the front-door, and schedules and operates the performance of the washer, dryer, and refrigerators. The AMI, one of the pillars of smart grids, governs the aggregate total load of the household in real-time and connects to Demand Response schemes (business models that are based on the alteration of consumption patterns based on downstream pricing
signals), while simultaneously it feeds back data on all attached technologies to the user and utility through an in-house display. But also Intelligent Energy Storage Systems that manage a host of technologies known as balance of system technologies, while simultaneously interfacing with utilities or other third parties for ancillary services based on network status and congestion.
It is the slightly dumber technologies that are of interest to me in this workshop. Those that are captured, aggregated, and controlled by the deep smart platforms that are essential to an efficient household. Together the lightbulbs, tv's, and motion sensor are becoming the extension of the material infrastructures as they are recognized and instrumentalized by the upstream management systems.

While my own research is not practice based. For this workshop it would be interesting to see if it
possible if there are ways to mask the load profiles of dumb technologies both in terms of energy
management and business management systems and make them dynamic. This could just mean
attaching a separate controllable load bearing entity to the appliance that gives of a volatile load
profile and therefor distorts the normal sequence of events and simultaneously connecting to the
stream of data that flows to the management system through an application such as Wireshark and
manipulate the communications. Micro actions as such would make devices hard to index
comprehensively and difficult to account for by the distributed depths of the parallel operating
cloud based databases, while it would still allow for the end-user to tap into the value streams by
changing their consumption based on downstream signals.
